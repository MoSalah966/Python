string is surrounded with '' like 
#print ('mohamed') >> mohamed is a string 
#print ('*' * 10) means ten astririsks.
variables 
#price = 10
we can use functions with variables like #print (price) >> 10 
here price is without quotations because it's a variable 
4.5 is a float or floating point number 
10 is integer 
variable set to string >> name = 'mohamed'
polean variable >> is_published = True 
T in true is upper case 
input is a function built in python 
-
name = input ('what is your name? ')

print ('Hi ' + name) 
-
name = 'mosh'

fav_color = 'blue'

print (name + ' likes ' + fav_color)
-
name = input('what is your name? ')

favourite_color = input('what is your favourite color? ')

print(name + " likes " + favourite_color)
-
birth_year = input('Birth year: ')

age = 2023 - int(birth_year)

print(age)
-
int, float, type, and bool are functions like input and print 
-
birth_year = input('Birth year: ')
print(type(birth_year))
age = 2023 - int(birth_year)
print(type(age))
print(age)
-
last code give class str and class int before printing age 
-
weight_in_pounds= input('what is your weight in pounds? ')

weight = (int(weight_in_pounds) / 2.20462262)

print("your weight in kilo is " + str(weight))
-
weight_in_pounds= input('weight (lbs): ')

weight = (int(weight_in_pounds) / 2.20462262)

print("your weight in kilo is " + str(weight))
-
#course = "python's course for beginners"
write double quote to can write apostrophe '
#course = 'python for "beginners"'
write single quotes to can write double quotes in the middle 
-
course = '''

hi salah,

this is the msp team

'''
-
course = 'python for beginners'
print(course[0]) >> p 
-
course = 'python for beginners'
print(course[-1]) >> s 
-
course = 'python for beginners'
print(course[0:3]) >> pyt 
-
course = 'python for beginners'
print(course[0:]) >> python for beginners 
-
course = 'python for beginners'
another = course[:]
print(another) >> python for beginners 
-
---Formatted String---
-
first = 'john'
last = 'smith'
message = first + ' [' + last + '] is a coder'
print(message) >> john [smith] is a coder 
- or 
first = 'john'
last = 'smith'
message = f'{first} [{last}] is a coder'
print(message) >> john [smith] is a coder
-
to define formatted strings, prifix your string with f and then use curly braces to dynamically 
insert values into your strings 
-
course = 'python for beginners'
print(len(course))
-
len is a built function to calculate the length of string 
methods are functions that belongs to something else or specific to some kind of object 
methods like string.upper and functions like print or len 
-
course = 'python for beginners'
print(course.upper()) >> PYTHON FOR BEGINNERS
-
course = 'python for beginners'
print(course.find('p')) >> 0 
-
course = 'python for beginners'
print(course.replace('beginners', 'absolute beginners')) 
>> python for absolute beginners
-
course = 'python for beginners'
print('python' in course) >> true 
-
the last code is a boolean value that gives true or false with "in operator"
----------------------------
---arithmetic operations---
-
print(10 / 3) >> 3.33333
-
print(10 // 3) >> 3 
-
print(10 % 3) >> the remaining of the devision
-
print(10 ** 3) >> the power 
-
augemented assignment operator is += 
so x = x + 3 is equal to x += 3

-
x = 10
x -= 3
print(x) >> 7
-
------------------
-
x = 2.8
print(round(x)) >> 3 
-
round give the approximate value 
-
x = 2.8
print(abs(-2.9)) >> 2.9
-
import math  << this make math a string and can use methods with it like 

-
import math 
print(math.ceil(2.9))  >> 3
-
import math 
print(math.floor(2.9))  >> 2 
-

---if statements---
-
is_cold = True 
is_hot = False 

if is_hot:
    print("it's a hot day")
    print("drink some water")
elif is_cold:
    print("it's a cold day")
    print("wear warm clothes")
else:
    print("enjoy your day")
-
price = 1000000
has_good_credit= True 
if has_good_credit:
    down_payment = 0.1 * price 
else:
    down_payment = 0.2 * price
print(f"down payment: ${down_payment}") >> down payment: $100000.0
-
------------------------------------
---logical operator---
-
has_high_income = False
has_good_credit = True

if has_high_income and has_good_credit:
    print("Eligable for loan") 
-
and: both 
or: at least one 
not: none 
-
has_good_credit = True 
has_criminal_record = False

if has_good_credit and not has_criminal_record:
    print("Eligable for loan")
-
-----------------------
---comparison operators---
-
temperature = 30
if temperature > 30:
    print("it's a hot day")
else:
    print("it's not a hot day")
-
temperature = 30
if temperature == 30:
    print("it's a hot day")
else:
    print("it's not a hot day")
-
== equal  ,, != not equal 

-
name = 'mohamed'

if len(name) < 3:
    print("name must be at least 3 characters")
elif len(name) > 50:
    print("name can be a maximum of 50 characters")
else:
    print('name looks good')
-
--------------------------------------
weight = int(input('weight: '))
unit = input('(L)bs or (k)g: ')
if unit.upper() == "L":
    converted = weight * 0.45
    print(f"you are {converted} kilos")
else:
    converted = weight / 0.45
    print(f"you are {converted} pounds")
------------------------------------------
---while loops---
-
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
-
this is an infinite loop 
-
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
print("done")
>> 1 2 3 4 5 done 
-
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print('*' * i) 
    i = i + 1
print("done")
-
secret_number = 9
guess_count = 0
guess_limit = 3
while guess_count < guess_limit:
    guess = int(input('guess: '))
    guess_count += 1
    if guess == secret_number:
        print('you won!')
        break
else:
    print('you failed!')
-
command = ""
started = False
while True:
    command = input(">" ).lower()
    if command == "start":
        if started:
            print("car already started")
        else:
            started = True
            print("car started")
    elif command == "stop":
        if not started:
            print("car already stopped")
        else:
            started = False 
            print("car stopped.")
    elif command == "help":
        print('''
start ... to start the car
stop ... to stop the car 
quit to exit
        ''')
    elif command == "quit":
        break
    else:
        print("i cannot understand")
---------------------------------------
---For Loops---
in while loop we execute a block of code multiple times
-
for item in ['mohamed', 'ahmed', 'sarah']:
    print(item) >> mohamed ahmed sarah
-
for item in range(10):
    print(item) >> 0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
-
in the coming for loop, 5 is the start, 10 is the range, 2 is the step for the function
for item in range(5, 10, 2):
    print(item) >
5
7
9
-
prices = [10, 20, 30]
total = 0
for price in prices:
    total += price
print(f"total: {total}") >> total: 60
----------------------------------------
---Nested Loops---
a coordinate is a list of (x, y) values like (0, 0)
generate a list of coordinate with nested loops
(x, y)
(0, 0)
(0, 1)
(0, 2)
(1, 0)
(1, 1)
so we can generate this list of coordinates with nested loops
-
for x in range(4):
    for y in range(3):
        print(f"{x}, {y}")
>
0, 0
0, 1
0, 2
1, 0
1, 1
1, 2
2, 0
2, 1
2, 2
3, 0
3, 1
3, 2
-
in 'for y in range(3)' this is called inner loop
-
numbers = [5, 2, 5, 2, 2]
for x in numbers:
    for y in 'x':
        print(y * x) >>
xxxxx
xx
xxxxx
xx
xx
-
numbers = [5, 2, 5, 2, 2]
for x_count in numbers:
    output = ''
    for count in range(x_count):
        output += 'x'
    print(output)
xxxxx
xx
xxxxx
xx
xx
