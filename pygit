string is surrounded with '' like 
#print ('mohamed') >> mohamed is a string 
#print ('*' * 10) means ten astririsks.
variables 
#price = 10
we can use functions with variables like #print (price) >> 10 
here price is without quotations because it's a variable 
4.5 is a float or floating point number 
10 is integer 
variable set to string >> name = 'mohamed'
polean variable >> is_published = True 
T in true is upper case 
input is a function built in python 
-
name = input ('what is your name? ')

print ('Hi ' + name) 
-
name = 'mosh'

fav_color = 'blue'

print (name + ' likes ' + fav_color)
-
name = input('what is your name? ')

favourite_color = input('what is your favourite color? ')

print(name + " likes " + favourite_color)
-
birth_year = input('Birth year: ')

age = 2023 - int(birth_year)

print(age)
-
int, float, type, and bool are functions like input and print 
-
birth_year = input('Birth year: ')
print(type(birth_year))
age = 2023 - int(birth_year)
print(type(age))
print(age)
-
last code give class str and class int before printing age 
-
weight_in_pounds= input('what is your weight in pounds? ')

weight = (int(weight_in_pounds) / 2.20462262)

print("your weight in kilo is " + str(weight))
-
weight_in_pounds= input('weight (lbs): ')

weight = (int(weight_in_pounds) / 2.20462262)

print("your weight in kilo is " + str(weight))
